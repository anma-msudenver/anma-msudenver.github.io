## Biography
I am Dr. Andong Ma, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences at Metropolitan State University of Denver. My research bridges deep learning and remote sensing, with a focus on environmental object detection (e.g., large-wood mapping in river floodplains) using frameworks like Faster R-CNN and YOLOv8. I hold a Ph.D. in Geography and have published extensively on AI-driven change detection and land-use classification. Beyond research, I am committed to mentoring the next generation of geospatial scientists, teaching courses in GNSS and remote sensing, and fostering GIS community engagement through workshops and events.
